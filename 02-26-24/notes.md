- New professor maybe?
- New homework assignment with stack and math coprocessor
- When talking about complexity, we care about how it scales
- The notation is Big O Notation: $O(n)$, where the O stands for order, so "of order n"
- See code for sorting example. If the size of the list to be sorted doubles, the iterations quadruple. So this sorting is of quadratic complexity, or $O(n^2)$
- See code for matrix multiplication of order $O(n^3)$
- Random access of arrays is constant time complexity, which is the most ideal
- If you have a small sample size, an exponential complexity algorithm works!
- Fibonacci is recursive, and hence exponential complexity
- Dynamic Programming: Space-time tradoffs
- Question for next time: Can we get better than linear but worse than constant?

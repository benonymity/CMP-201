- Programming with efficiency in mind
- Scope within the stack: main at bottom, everything it calls on top, returning in reverse order of getting added
- Recursion within functions
- \# Active functions = recursion length
- Best practice is passing references to functions
- `const` keyword
- Don't return pointers to stack allocated variables
-

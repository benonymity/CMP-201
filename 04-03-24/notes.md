- Tree:
    - Connected, acyclic graph
    - Forest
    - The root is first (has no predecessor), and as nodes without successors are called leaves
    - Predecessor and successor or parent and child nodes
- Tree Traversal: 
    - Depth first search 
    - breadth first search
- Binary Search Tree:
    - At most two successor nodes
    - Left successor ≤ predecessor ≤ right successsor
    - Complexity is $O(\ln(n))$ instead of $O(n)$
    - Basically midpoint division
    - Tree must be balanced (number of nodes on left vs right should differ by no more than 1)
    - Every insertion you perform a balancing check
- AVL Tree
- Next time Huffman code!

- Exam 2:
    - OOP: Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, `virtual`, multiple inheritance, abstract classes, template
    - Hash tables (collision resolution, space-time tradeoff)
    - Complexity
    - Graphs: vocabulary (cycles, trees, weighted, connected, etc.), adjacency matrices, algorithims (DFS, BFS, shortest path, spanning trees), binary Search Tree (what it is, balanced, AVL), heaps: sort
- Final: 
    - May 8th @ 8:15 AM
    - Previous two exams
    - Red black trees, smart pointers
- Runtime stack allocates memory on the heap, but when it's overwritten the memory address is lost, even though the memory is still there. Memory leak.
- Smart pointer! Basically little memory classes that have ownership controls
- Unique pointer! Similar idea

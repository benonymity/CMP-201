### Taught by Dr. Seiffert

Folders are made for each class with a Markdown file of notes (`notes.md`) and at least one `.cpp` file (i.e. `01-17-24.cpp`). If you're not me, you can probably ignore the build script and use whatever your IDE of choice provides for building. I had to make it because neovim just isn't that fancy ;)

# CMP-201
### Taught by Dr. Seiffert

Folders made for each class with a Markdown file of notes (i.e. `1-17-24.md`) and at least one `.cpp` file (i.e. `1-17-24.cpp`). If you're not me, you can probably ignore the build script and use whatever your IDE of choice provides for building. Neovim just isn't that fancy ;)

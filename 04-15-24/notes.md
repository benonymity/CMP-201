- Minimum Spanning Tree
- [Greedy Algorithim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)
    - Selection: Pick an edge according to a locally optimal consideration
    - Feasibility Check: Make sure adding the edge does not create a cycle
    - Solution Check: Do we have a spanning tree? ([Prim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm), [Kruskel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm))
- [Floyd Algorithim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm) and Shortest Path
